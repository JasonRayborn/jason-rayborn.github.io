/*Operators*/


/*Operators are used to perform some operation on a 
single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result*/

/*Assignment Operator*/
/*An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand
based on the value of its right operand


/*Example*/
//Assignment operator
let x = 1; //assigns the value of 1 to x
console.log(x); // logs 1 to the console


//Addition assignment
a += 5; 
console.log(a); //a = a + 5


//Subtraction assignment
a -= 2; 
console.log(a); //a = a - 2


//Multiplication assignment
a *= 3;
console.log(a); //a = a * 3


//Division assignment 
a /= 2;
console.log(a); //a = a / 2


//Remainder assignment
a %= 2;
console.log(a); //a = a % 2





/*Comparsion Operator*/
/*A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical
value based on whether the comparison is true*/
/*Example*/
let num = 1;
let num2 = 2;
num == num2; //"Loose Equal" //Returns true if the operands are equal
num != num2; //"Loose Not Equal" // Returns true if opreands are not equal
num === num2; //"Strict Equal" // Returns true if both operands are true and same type
num !== num2; //"Strict not Equal" Returns true if operands are same type but not equal, or are different types
num > num2; //"Greater than" Returns true if left operand is greater than right
num < num2; //"Less than" returns true if left operand is less than right
num >= num2; //"Greater than or equal" Returns true if left operand is greater or equal to right
num <= num2; //"Less than or equal" Returns true if left operand is less or equal to right


/*Arithmetic operator*/
/*The arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) 
as their operands and returns a single numerical value*/
/*Examples*/
/* Remainder %: Binary operator that returns the integer remainder from division
*Increment ++: Unary operator that adds one to its operand.
*Decrement --: Unary operator that subtracts one from the operand
*Add +: Adds both operands 
*Subtract -: Subtract both operands 
*Multiply *: Multiply both operands together
*Divide /: Divide both operands
*/
var additionOutput = 2 + 2; //addition
var subtractionOutput = 2 - 2; //subtraction
var multiplcationOutput = 2 * 2; //multiplcation
var divisionOutput = 2 / 2; //division
var exponentiation = 2**2; // Exponentiation
var modulus = 5 % 2; // Modulus (Remainder)


/*Logical Operators*/
/*Logical operators are typically used with Booleans (logical) values; when they are 
used, they return a Boolean value*/
/*Examples*/
/*&& Operator: sum1 && sum2 / Returns sum1 if it can be converted to false, otherwise 
returns sum2. If both operands are true, it returns true.
*OR || Operator: sum1 || sum2 / Returns sum1 if it can be converted to true, otherwise
it returns sum2. If both are are true, it returns true, otherwise if both are false,
it returns false.
*Not ! Operator: !sum1 / Returns false if its single operand that can be converted
to true, otherwise it returns true.
*/
let a = 1;
let b = 4;
if (a || b) {
   console.log("I will run if either a or b are true");
}

if (a && b) {
   console.log("I will run, if and only if a and b are both true");
}

if (!a) {
   console.log("I will only run if a is false");
}

if (a) {
   console.log("I will only run if a is true");
}


/*Conditional (ternary) Operator*/
/*This conditional operator is the only JS operator that takes three operands.
The operator can have one or two values based on a condition.
condition ? value1 : value2 === The syntax
*/
/*Example*/
let ofAge = (16 >= 18) ? "adult" : "minor";
console.log(ofAge); // returns "minor"


/*Unary Operator*/
/*A unary operation is an operation with only one operand. 
This operand comes either before or after the operator.
*/
/*Example*/
/*Operator	Explanation
Unary plus (+)	Tries to convert the operand into a number
Unary negation (-)	Tries to convert the operand into a number and negates after
Increment (++)	Adds one to its operand
Decrement (--)	Decrements by one from its operand
Logical NOT (!)	Converts to boolean value then negates it
